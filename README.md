# ðŸ”„ Customer Churn Prediction â€“ PowerCo (BCG X Virtual Experience)

This project was completed as part of the **BCG X Data Science Virtual Experience** on Forage. It simulates real-world data science workflows to predict customer churn using structured customer behavior data, focusing on feature engineering, model training, and interpretation.

## âœ… Task Overview

### âœ… Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis & Feature Engineering
- Transformed datetime columns into numerical features (e.g., months since last renewal).
- Converted categorical variables into dummy/indicator variables.
- Handled Boolean variables and assessed churn impact.
- Identified and treated skewed features using logarithmic transformation.

### âœ… Task 2: Predictive Modeling
- Trained a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict churn using a 75-25 train-test split.
- Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
- Generated churn probabilities for out-of-sample data.
- Visualized feature importance to understand key drivers of churn.

### âœ… Task 3: Correlation Analysis & Feature Selection
- Created a correlation heatmap to identify highly correlated features.
- Removed redundant variables to reduce multicollinearity.
- Ensured final feature set met model assumptions and improved interpretability.
